# Vermont Deer Roadkill Map
Chloropleth map of deer roadkill in Vermont, 2011-2014

Data from [Vermont Fish and Wildlife](http://www.vtfishandwildlife.com/), using Wildlife Management Units, which is an interesting way of dividing up the state. I pulled the geojson boundaries in js file from [here](http://data.vtanr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7d698ab4dcf46579a462b1ebd89f21d_15), with no shortage of headaches.
